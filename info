# Create the project directory and switch to it with:
mkdir ~/my-first-vagrant-project
cd ~/my-first-vagrant-project

# Run the following command to initialize a new Vagrantfile:
vagrant init centos/7

# To create and configure the virtual machine as specified in the Vagrantfile:
vagrant up

# To ssh into the virtual machine, run:
vagrant ssh

# TO shutdown the virtual machine with the following command:
vagrant halt

# Reload the VM
vagrant reload

# To delete the VM described in the Vagrantfile:
vagrant destroy

# To send the VM to sleep:
vagrant suspend

# To wake the VM from sleep:
vagrant resume

# This command can be run in any directory. And it will return the list of machines along with the state and the directory where the Vagrantfile is located.
vagrant global-status

# To show the list of forwarded tcp ports
vagrant port
